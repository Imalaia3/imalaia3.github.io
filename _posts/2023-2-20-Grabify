title: How to detect Grabify links
---
Have you ever clicked on a link that gets your IP?

If so, you probably want to prevent that from happening again. but you don't want to use an extension. So, let me show you how to detect grabify links in python!


First, we need to import the "requests" module in order to get the contents of a website.

Then, we should get the users input and store it in a variable `link = input("Enter your URL > ")`

Now let's get to the good part. Since you need to click accept before grabify pulls your IP, we can find if a website is made by Grabify by searching
for "grabify" in its contents. Having to press "Accept" also makes our detector undetectable since it does not click any buttons.

Get the websites content `cont = requests.get(link).text`

Next, use the `string.find()` method in order to search for grabify: `occur = cont.find("grabify")`. This gives us the index of the occurance.
Note that this will trigger if grabify is mentioned in a page.

Here is the code:
